# ☆ Hello, I'm Caspian!!!!
♪ ~ I mostly hang out in the 18+ server, I also line break a lot so if I get muted thats why yay! I also accept c + h but please tell me first <3

☆ I'm always with a friend or two! My main best friend is Sylvie and we talk a lot about weird things so if you're uncomfy PLEEASSE tell me! I dont really like hanging out with people I dont know IRL or haven't known long enough though, since I'm a really awkward person..

☆ And if anything makes you uncomfortable about me, please dont hesitate to warn me politely! sometimes I derail and start saying weird things or start venting in public so please, please PLEASE warn me instead of staying quiet!

☆ I'm into a LOT of classical literature like 1984, Moby Dick, Wuthering Heights, 20K Leagues and more!!! Though I am a newbie at the classics.. I also like Project Moon, WonderEnd 0 and TPTM!
